Project Name: ReadTrack: Your Personal Bookshelf in the Cloud 

For Whom?
ReadTrack is primarily designed for avid readers and book enthusiasts. This includes individuals who frequently purchase books, members of book clubs, and students who need to keep track of their reading for academic purposes. Additionally, it caters to librarians and educators who wish to recommend books to others or monitor reading progress. Essentially, ReadTrack is for anyone who loves reading and wants an organized, digital means to track their reading habits, discover new books, and connect with a community of like-minded individuals.

How?
From the perspective of an end-user, ReadTrack will function as follows:
User Registration and Profile Creation: Users can sign up and create a personalized profile, where they can list their reading interests, favorite genres, and books they wish to read.
Book Tracking: Users can add books to their digital shelf, categorize them as 'Read', 'Currently Reading', or 'Want to Read', and keep track of their reading progress (e.g., page number or percentage completed).
Reading History and Statistics: The app provides an overview of the user’s reading habits, including the number of books read, average reading time, genres explored, etc.
Book Recommendations: Based on the user’s reading history and preferences, the app suggests new books and authors they might enjoy.
Community Interaction: Users can connect with other readers, join virtual book clubs, participate in discussions, and share book reviews and recommendations.
Mobile and Web Accessibility: The application is accessible via both a web interface and a mobile application, ensuring users can update and check their reading status on-the-go.

Scope
The development of ReadTrack is a suitable challenge for a group of 4-6 programmers over one semester. The project is complex enough to be engaging, involving front-end development for a user-friendly interface, back-end development for database management and recommendation algorithms, and perhaps some level of machine learning for personalized suggestions. However, it's not overly ambitious as it builds upon existing concepts of digital libraries and social networks. The project allows for scalable goals: a basic functional app can be created initially with scope for adding more advanced features like community forums or more sophisticated recommendation algorithms as stretch goals. This balance makes ReadTrack a feasible yet stimulating project for the given team size and timeframe.
